# Wallethub Log Parser
Project created for the WalletHub team to get a better idea of my technical and problem-solving skills

## Instructions
The goal is to write a parser in Java that parses web server access log file, loads the log to MySQL and checks if a 
given IP makes more than a certain number of requests for the given duration. 

### Java

1. Create a java tool that can parse and load the given log file to MySQL. The delimiter of the log file is pipe (|)
1. The tool takes "startDate", "duration" and "threshold" as command line arguments. "startDate" is of 
`yyyy-MM-dd.HH:mm:ss` format, "duration" can take only "hourly", "daily" as inputs and "threshold" can be an integer.
1. This is how the tool works:

```
java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=hourly --threshold=100
```

The tool will find any IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00 
(one hour) and print them to console AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.

```
java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --startDate=2017-01-01.13:00:00 --duration=daily --threshold=250
```

The tool will find any IPs that made more than 250 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-02.13:00:00 
(24 hours) and print them to console AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.

### SQL

1. Write MySQL query to find IPs that mode more than a certain number of requests for a given time period.

> E.g.: Write SQL to find IPs that made more than 100 requests starting from 2017-01-01.13:00:00 to 2017-01-01.14:00:00.

1. Write MySQL query to find requests made by a given IP.

## Setup
Run the `src/main/resources/db/model.sql` file into the MySQL server. The configuration of such server must be compliant
to the specified in the `persistence.xml`:

* user: root
* password: root


## Observations and recommendations

1. To run a standalone jar better use `parser-jar-with-dependencies.jar` with something like:

    ```
    java -jar parser-jar-with-dependencies.jar --startDate=2017-11-01.00:30:00  --duration=daily --threshold=2
    ```
    
1. To try out the previous example with my test data you can use the `src/main/resources/db/sample-data.sql` 
   to seed your database or parse the file `src/main/resources/db/sample-requests.log`.    

1. As the details for loading the log file were not given it will be supposed that the param `--logfile` will be provided.
    E.g.

    ```
    java -cp "parser.jar" com.ef.Parser --logfile=/home/EliuX/requests.log
    ```
    
    As the format of the request log was not specified It will be supposed a format like
    
    ```
    <date> <ip>
    ```
    
    This approach is better than specifying the log path directly because it allows in a single command line
    to upload a log file and also make a query at the same time.
    
    E.g.
    > 1985-11-06.00:30:00 192.168.0.1| 1985-11-06 127.0.0.1| 1990-11-06.00:30:00 127.0.0.1
    

1. I did not understand 

    >...AND also load them to another MySQL table with comments on why it's blocked.

    What is the source of these comments?
